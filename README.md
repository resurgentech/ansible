# Basic Ansible Configurations for Desktop, Workstations, and Baremetal servers

## Using to configure a fresh machine ##

### Installing ansible locally ###

Run the appropriate script from ./manual_scripts/ with sudo

Example:
```
sudo ./manual_scripts/ansible_install_ubuntu_20.04.sh
```

This allows you to use ansible locally to configure the machine as opposed to registering it with a remote ansible instance like Tower.

### Install ansible galaxy modules ###
This step will install the required 3rd party modules.
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force
```
### Run ansible to configure machine ###

```
./setup_localhost.sh
```

Will prompt for BECOME password, in this context, this is current user's password required to run sudo.
